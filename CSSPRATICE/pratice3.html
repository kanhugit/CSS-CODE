        <p><strong>Lola: KEY</strong></p>
        <p class="highlight-green">She loves to play with anything that moves, from cat toys to bugs to feet.</p>
        <p class="highlight-red">Her favorite toy is a stuffed catnip mouse, and chasing a ping pong ball around the house is another favorite activity.</p>
        <p class="highlight-yellow">Lola is very affectionate when she is not in a playful mood.</p>
        <p class="highlight-red">She loves when we pet her and purrs loudly to show that she likes it.</p>
        <p class="highlight-red">She often curls up beside us while we’re on the computer or watching TV.</p>
        <p class="highlight-red">Lola also loves to sleep with us in bed.</p>
        <p class="highlight-green">Lola is also very curious and likes to follow us around the house to see what we’re doing.</p>
        <p class="highlight-red">If there’s something new, she wants to join in and investigate it.</p>
